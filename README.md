## :wave:  Introduction

As part of our commitment to promoting the VeChain ecosystem, we offer comprehensive grants and bounty programs focused on funding applications development and research efforts related to **Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc**. For more information about the VeChain Foundation grants and bounty programs, please visit our [website](https://vechain.org/).

The General Grant Program tries to achieve the above while being:

- fully transparent,
- simple, and
- effective.

### Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a general grant. Projects funded through our programs are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong technical projects that add value to the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances to get accepted if:

- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources, or an existing business model.
- Your team has **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. We ask you to provide the GitHub profiles of all team members as part of your application and will examine these for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. 
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale. However, we do not limit the project's option to do token sales in the future.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.

In addition to the information provided on your application, note that your project will need to comply with our [Grant Milestone Delivery](/milestone-delivery/README.md). In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, _written_ documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product. If your team's background is purely technical, consider hiring a freelance or part-time technical writer as part of the grant.


### Support

The scope of our General Grants Programs consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources through [VeChain Dev Community](https://t.me/VeChainDevCommunity). 

### Team

#### VeChain Grant Committee

The committee consists of individuals who know the funding priorities of the VeChain ecosystem and is responsible for evaluating grant applications and providing feedback on these.

In cases where a niche expert opinion is desirable, one of the committee members may request such a review.

- [Sunny Lu]()
- [Bin Qian](https://github.com/qianbin)
- pending？

#### VeChain Grant Evaluators

Evaluators are individuals who will perform the preliminary review to check whether the application is formatted correctly and includes all the requested information. The committee has the right to add or remove evaluators baseed on a supermajority.

## Process

1. **Application**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/vechain/Grants-Program/) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)) or the research template([`applications/research-template.md`](applications/research-template.md)).Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. Please read the [disclaimer](disclaimer.md) carefully before applying for VeChain General Grant.
2. **Preliminary Review**
   1. The [Evaluators](#vechain-grant-evaluators) will check if the application is formatted correctly and includes all requested information. 
   2. The [Evaluators](#vechain-grant-evaluators) can (and usually does) issue comments and request additional information on the pull request.
   3. The [Evaluators](#vechain-grant-evaluators) will label the pull request "ready for committee review" if the application passed the preliminary review.
3. **Committee Review**
   1. The [committee](#vechain-grant-committee) can (and usually does) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by modifying your application directly and leaving a comment once you're done.
   3. The application is accepted when all requested changes are addressed, and one committee member approves your pull request.
4. **Milestone Delivery and Payment**
   1. Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](milestone-delivery) repository. You can find the delivery process [here](milestone-delivery#mailbox-milestone-delivery-process).


The grant application can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
