## Introduction

The competitiveness and long-term success of a public blockchain platform depend on its developer community and ecosystem stakeholders to constantly bring innovations and values to the platform. To attract more developers and projects to join VeChain's ecosystem and eventually bring more valuable transactions on VeChainThor, VeChain provides comprehensive grant and bounty programs, including General Grant Program, Bug Bounty, Hackathon, etc. All of these programs are focusing on funding applications development and research efforts related to **Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc**. For more information about the VeChain Foundation grants and bounty programs, please visit our [website](https://vechain.org/).

The VeChain General Grant Program focuses on supporting ecosystem projects and researches, the grant will be up to **$30,000 for every application**, which are tracked **transparently** on GitHub and disbursed in **USDT(ERC 20)**. **Once the application is accepted, the first payment will be immediately disbursed to fund the project.**

**With sincere appreciation for long-term support from Economic X Nodes holders, VeChain will support 50% additional funds for Economic X node. It's notable that you have to send an email([`applications/email-template.md`](applications/email-template.md)) to bounty@vechain.com to claim the additional grant.**


## Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a general grant. Projects funded through our programs are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong technical projects related to **Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc** which add value to the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances to get accepted if:

- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which ideally you can show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources, or an existing business model.
- Your team has **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. We ask you to provide the GitHub profiles of all team members as part of your application and will examine these for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.
- You can present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. 
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale. However, we do not limit the project's option to do token sales in the future.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.

In addition to the information provided on your application, note that your project will need to comply with our [Grant Milestone Delivery](/milestone-delivery/README.md). In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, _written_ documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product. If your team's background is purely technical, consider hiring a freelance or part-time technical writer as part of the grant.


## Application Process

1. **Application**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/vechain/Grant-Program/) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)) or the research template([`applications/research-template.md`](applications/research-template.md)).Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. Please read the [disclaimer](disclaimer.md) carefully before applying for VeChain General Grant.
2. **Preliminary Review**

   After its submission, an application moves into the preliminary review stage where an administrator will be designated to check whether the application is formatted correctly and includes all the requested information. The [Evaluators](#vechain-grant-evaluators) will label the pull request "ready for committee review" if the application passed the preliminary review.
   
3. **Committee Review**

   A five-member grant committee will evaluate, comment and make decisions on all the applications passing the preliminary review. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by modifying your application directly and leaving a comment once you're done.The application is accepted when all requested changes are addressed, and one committee member approves your pull request. And the final decisions made by the committee will be put on the website to notify applicants and the community. 
 
4. **Milestone Delivery and Payment**

   Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](./milestone-delivery) repository. You can find the delivery process [here](milestone-delivery#mailbox-milestone-delivery-process). **Once the application is accepted, the first payment will be immediately disbursed to fund the project.**

   The grant application can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
